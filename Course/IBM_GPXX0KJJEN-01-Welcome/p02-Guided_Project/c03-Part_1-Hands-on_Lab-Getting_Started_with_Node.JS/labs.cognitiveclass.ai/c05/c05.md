# Conclusion

Great job. You did it! You officially know how to build a Node.js app. We learned what Node.js is and how to use NPM to import useful packages and libraries. We ran our app using Express and finally, we also added some style to the app by rendering an html file instead of plain text.

I hope you enjoyed as much as I did creating this project.
