# Getting Started with Node.js

**Estimated Time:** 15 minutes

Hello there. You came here because you want to learn about Node.js, a very popular technology for building web apps. Traditionally, JavaScript was only able to run on a browser, but Node.js allows JavaScript to run on a server. You can call Node.js a runtime, a platform, or an environment that allowed JavaScript to run on a server. Which allowed apps to be entirely written in JavaScript.

>*Node.js is **not** a framework.*

Anyhow, I welcome you to this Guided Project.

## What you will achieve

- Use Node.js and NPM to create an application that prints “Hello World”.
- Run the application through the Skills Network extension.
- Add some style to your application.

## What You Will Need

- A computer, obviously
- Willingness to learn and challenge yourself!

## Additional Notes

- **This app is yours.** Feel free to add more pages, and features after this project to make this project more awesome.
- **Google is your best friend.** You might face bugs and some things may not work on your machine even if you follow everything step by step. This is where you willingness to learn comes in, google the error you are seeing and try to figure it out.
- **Have FUN**
