>*Ensure that you understand the code in each file. These are primitive and foundational for your understanding of Node JS*

1. Clone the remote repository.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ibm-developer-skills-network/NodeJSPracticeLabs.git
    ```

2. Change to the exercise directory.

    ```bash
    cd NodeJSPracticeLabs
    ```
